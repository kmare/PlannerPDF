![Build Status](https://github.com/revelationnow/PlannerPDF/actions/workflows/cmake.yml/badge.svg)

This will generate a PDF File that can be used as a planner on the remarkable platform.<br>
It uses the libharu library to generate the PDF and the Date library to perform calendar math.

# Available Samples
Several sample files are available for use which don't require you to compile the code and generate the files yourself.
Each sample file has an original file and compressed version which is smaller in size but maintains most of the fidelity of the original.
The different files are labeled according to their differences.
The samples directory structure is divided into a lefthanded/righthanded tree under which it has portrati and landscape directories under which there are separate options for monday start Sunday start files.


# How to compile
Make sure you have libharu development library installed. Either compiled from source or from your package manager.

For Ubuntu/Debian:

    sudo apt-get install libhpdf-dev

For Fedora/CentOS:

    sudo dnf install libharu-devel

The libharu github page is at:

  https://github.com/libharu/libharu

The date library is part of this repository. It has its own license and is obtained from:

  https://github.com/HowardHinnant/date


# Compilation
Clone the repository then create a build directory and run cmake followed by make. The below is the default usage.

    git clone https://github.com/revelationnow/PlannerPDF.git
    cd PlannerPDF
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake ..
    make create

The `make create` command will generate a file called planner.pdf in the build directory which can be used as is. The file size can be large depending for the default settings. The following cmake options are available to modify:

    Option                                 | Default Value       | Comment
    _______________________________________|_____________________|_______________________________________________________________
    PDF_FILENAME                           | planner             | The filename used for the generated pdf (no extension)
    START_YEAR                             | 2021                | The starting year for the planner
    NUM_YEARS                              | 5                   | The number of years in the planner. Reduce this to reduce size
    COMPRESSED_FILE                        | planner_compressed  | The filename of a compressed version of the file
    Planner_PDF_Start_Day                  | 0                   | This allows moving the start day of the month view to a day other than Sunday
                                           |                     | 0 : Sun, 1 : Mon, 2 : Tue, 3 : Wed, 4 : Thu, 5 : Fri, 6 : Sat
    Planner_PDF_Portrait                   | 0                   | 0 : Landscape, 1 : Portrait


There is a make target called `make compress` which will us ghostscript to try to reduce the filesize. For the 5 year planner it can bring the size down from ~43mb to ~19mb.

Below is an example of invoking the build with additional options. This will set the dedault output filename to calendar.pdf set the start year to 2020 set the number of yeaers in the planner to 1 year, name the compressed version of the file calendar_small.pdf and set the start day of the week in the month view to Monday

    git clone https://github.com/revelationnow/PlannerPDF.git
    cd PlannerPDF
    mkdir build
    cd build
    cmake -DNUM_YEARS=1 -DPDF_FILENAME=calendar -DSTART_YEAR=2020 -DCOMPRESSED_FILE=calendar_small -DPlanner_PDF_Start_Day=1 ..
    make compress

There is additionally a make target to update the samples in the samples directory. To invoke that, use `make update_samples` for the default file and `make update_compressed_samples` for the compressed file. When naming the samples file, it will append x_year in the file name.

# Usage
